# AwesomeChocolatesDashboard-Tableau

## Project Overview

This dashboard was created in Tableau with the aim to analyze sales data for Awesome Chocolates which was extracted from Excel as a xlsx file to determine the key sales patterns. The focus is on identifying the top 5 sales performers, along with a breakdown of sales figures by product and country. 

By developing country-specific filters and creating well-structured, visually compelling charts, the goal is to offer a clear and interactive experience for the users. This allows the stakeholders to drill down into sales data and extract meaningful insights that can guide strategies and help in decision making.
